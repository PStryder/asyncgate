# .claude/ Directory Convention

**Purpose:** AI workspace for session continuity and working files

## What goes here:

- **Session notes** (SESSION_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- **Progress tracking** (REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md, etc.)
- **AI collaboration notes** (HEXY_REFINEMENTS.md, corrections, clarifications)
- **Temporary working files** (commit messages, scratch notes)
- **Permission settings** (settings.local.json - Claude Code/Desktop)

## What does NOT go here:

- Production code (`src/`, `tests/`)
- Project documentation (`docs/`, `README.md`)
- Specifications (`AsyncGate Spec.txt`)
- Build/deploy configs (`pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `alembic/`)

## Convention rationale:

**Keep the project tree clean** while preserving AI context across sessions.

Files in `.claude/` can be:
- Excluded from git (optional - add to .gitignore)
- Lost without breaking the project
- Useful for AI session handoffs and continuity

**For future AI sessions:**
- Read files in `.claude/` first to understand project state
- Store your working notes and progress tracking here
- Don't clutter the root directory with temporary AI artifacts

**Project owner preference:** Non-code AI-generated files that can be lost/not pushed belong here.
