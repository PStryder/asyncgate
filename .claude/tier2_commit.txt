Tier 2: Bootstrap replacement with obligation ledger endpoint

Add /v1/obligations/open endpoint implementing canonical bootstrap model.

NEW ENDPOINT: /v1/obligations/open
- Returns unbucketed obligation dump: {server, relationship, open_obligations, cursor}
- No attention semantics (no waiting_results, assigned_tasks, running_or_scheduled)
- No task state bucketing - pure ledger query
- Uses AsyncGateEngine.list_open_obligations() (added in Tier 0)
- Cursor-based pagination via since_receipt_id
- Server and relationship metadata for client awareness

DEPRECATION: /v1/bootstrap (old endpoint)
- Added deprecation notice in docstring
- Returns X-AsyncGate-Deprecated header
- Returns Deprecation: true header
- Logs warning on usage for migration tracking
- Still functional (no breaking changes)

NEW SCHEMA: OpenObligationsResponse
- Defines response structure for new endpoint
- Enforces unbucketed format (obligations + cursor only)

This completes the shift from "attention inbox" to "obligation ledger" model.
Agents now query open obligations directly from the receipt ledger, with
termination determined by receipt chain evidence (type semantics + DB queries).

Tests deferred to Tier 6 (no test framework yet).

Files changed:
- src/asyncgate/api/router.py: New endpoint + deprecation
- src/asyncgate/api/schemas.py: New response schema
- REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md: Mark Tier 2 complete
