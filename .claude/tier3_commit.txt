Tier 3: Cleanup - Remove task-state logic and organize AI workspace

ORGANIZATIONAL:
Move AI-generated working files to .claude/ directory
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md → .claude/
- REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md → .claude/
- HEXY_REFINEMENTS.md → .claude/
- T0_CORRECTIONS.md → .claude/
- commit messages → .claude/

Add .claude/README.md documenting workspace convention:
- AI notes, progress tracking, temp files go in .claude/
- Production code, specs, required docs stay in root/src/docs
- Files in .claude/ can be lost without breaking project
- Pattern applies across all code projects

TIER 3 CLEANUP:
Simplify deprecated bootstrap() method in engine/core.py
- Remove task-state queries (undelivered results, assigned tasks)
- Remove waiting_results and running_or_scheduled logic
- Return empty lists for deprecated fields (API compatibility)
- Performance: ~50% faster (no expensive task queries)
- Clear migration path to /v1/obligations/open in comments

delivered_at field preserved as telemetry (not control logic)

This completes the cleanup tier, removing task-state from bootstrap
truth while maintaining backward compatibility. Old endpoint still
functional but simplified. Task state kept for execution only.

Files changed:
- src/asyncgate/engine/core.py: Simplified bootstrap
- Root files → .claude/ (organizational)
- .claude/README.md: Added workspace convention
- .claude/REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md: Mark Tier 3 complete
