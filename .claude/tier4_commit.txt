Tier 4: CRITICAL - Separate lease expiry from retry backoff

Fix production footgun where worker crashes burned retry attempts.

PROBLEM:
Lease expiry was calling requeue_with_backoff(increment_attempt=True),
treating worker crash as task failure. Flaky workers caused tasks to hit
max_attempts prematurely, resulting in false terminal failures.

SOLUTION:
Semantic separation between "lost authority" and "task failed":

NEW: TaskRepository.requeue_on_expiry()
- Does NOT increment attempt counter (CRITICAL)
- Uses minimal jitter (0-5s) instead of exponential backoff
- Returns task to QUEUED status
- Called on lease expiry only

UPDATED: AsyncGateEngine.expire_leases()
- Changed from: requeue_with_backoff(increment_attempt=True)
- Changed to: requeue_on_expiry(jitter_seconds=random.uniform(0, 5))
- Simplified double-jitter logic (now handled in requeue_on_expiry)

PRESERVED: TaskRepository.requeue_with_backoff()
- Unchanged for actual task failures
- Still increments attempt counter (correct for real failures)
- Uses exponential backoff

IMPACT:
Worker crashes no longer eat retry attempts. Tasks can now survive
transient worker failures without hitting terminal state prematurely.

Files changed:
- src/asyncgate/db/repositories.py: Add requeue_on_expiry method
- src/asyncgate/engine/core.py: Update expire_leases to use new method
- .claude/REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md: Mark Tier 4 complete
