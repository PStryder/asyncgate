## H.1 Task Ownership — RESOLVED

### Decision

**Task ownership is immutable and authoritative.**

- `created_by` is set at task creation and **never changes**
- Ownership **does not transfer implicitly**
- Receipts provide *audit*, not authority

**Invariant:** At any time, exactly one principal is the authoritative owner of a task, defined by `created_by`. No other receipt or operation may change this field.

### Rule

```text
Task.owner := created_by at creation time (immutable)
Receipts do NOT modify ownership
```

### Optional (Future)

If ownership transfer is ever required, it MUST be explicit via:
- New receipt type: `task.transferred`
- Server-side validation
- Explicit update to `task.owner`

**v0:** Ownership transfer is **not supported**.
