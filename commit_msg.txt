Tier 0: Foundation for obligation ledger model (architectural realignment)

CONTEXT: AsyncGate currently conflates "task execution substrate" with
"attention delivery system". This commit begins realignment to correct model:
AsyncGate is a ledger of obligations, not a message broker.

TIER 0 FOUNDATION - Add New Patterns (No Breaking Changes)

1. Termination Registry (NEW: termination.py)
   - Defines how obligations are discharged through receipt chains
   - Maps obligation types to their terminal receipt types
   - Example: TASK_ASSIGNED → [TASK_COMPLETED, TASK_FAILED, TASK_CANCELED]
   - Functions: get_terminal_types, is_terminal_type, can_terminate
   - Core insight: Termination detected from ledger, not task state

2. Receipt Chain Query Primitives (repositories.py + engine/core.py)
   - Added ReceiptRepository.get_by_id(tenant_id, receipt_id)
   - Added ReceiptRepository.get_by_parent(tenant_id, parent_id, limit)
     * Uses PostgreSQL JSONB containment on parents array
     * Finds terminal receipts that discharge obligations
   - Added AsyncGateEngine.get_receipt()
   - Added AsyncGateEngine.list_receipts_by_parent()
   - Enables agents to walk receipt chains for verification

3. Open Obligations Query (THE BOOTSTRAP PRIMITIVE)
   - Added ReceiptRepository.list_open_obligations()
     * Queries obligation types (from termination registry)
     * Filters to principal
     * For each candidate, checks if terminal child exists
     * Returns only obligations WITHOUT terminal discharge
     * Pagination via since_receipt_id cursor
   - Added AsyncGateEngine.list_open_obligations()
     * Returns: {open_obligations: [Receipt], cursor: UUID}
     * Pure ledger dump, no bucketing, no interpretation
     * This IS correct bootstrap: uncommitted obligations

KEY CONCEPTS:

Obligation: Receipt that creates commitment (task.assigned, lease.granted)
Terminal Receipt: Receipt that discharges obligation (task.completed, etc.)
Parent Linkage: Terminal receipts MUST reference obligation via parents field
Open Obligation: Obligation without terminal child receipt

Without parent linkage → obligations stay open forever (haunted bootstrap)
Without locatability → work product unfindable ("SUCCEEDED trust me bro")

CURRENT vs TARGET MODEL:

Current (WRONG):
- Bootstrap = Attention system with interpreted buckets
- delivered_at controls visibility
- Task state = source of truth for obligations

Target (RIGHT):
- Bootstrap = Open obligations dump from ledger
- Receipt chains define termination (parents → terminal)
- Task state = execution tracking only

NO BREAKING CHANGES:
- All new code alongside existing
- Old bootstrap still works
- Enables Tier 1 enforcement (next commit)

NEXT STEPS (Tier 1):
- Enforce parent linkage on terminal receipts
- Enforce locatability on success discharge
- Add delivery_proof field to ReceiptBody

FILES CHANGED:
- src/asyncgate/models/termination.py (NEW - 158 lines)
- src/asyncgate/db/repositories.py (MODIFIED - added 3 methods, 135 lines)
- src/asyncgate/engine/core.py (MODIFIED - added 3 methods, 69 lines)
- REALIGNMENT_PROGRESS.md (NEW - comprehensive tracking doc)

Compiled cleanly. Ready for Tier 1 enforcement.
