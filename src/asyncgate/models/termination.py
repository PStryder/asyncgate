"""Obligation termination type semantics.

AsyncGate's termination registry defines WHAT types can terminate WHAT,
not HOW to detect termination. The database answers "did it happen."

Key principle: Termination is TYPE SEMANTICS + DB EVIDENCE.
- Static: "task.completed CAN terminate task.assigned" (this module)
- Runtime: "Does terminator receipt exist?" (database query)

This keeps AsyncGate dumb and fast - no semantic inference, no ledger scanning.

Type Rules:
- task.assigned → can be terminated by [task.completed, task.failed, task.canceled]
- lease.granted → can be terminated by [lease.released, lease.expired]
- schedule.created → can be terminated by [schedule.deleted, schedule.failed]

Parent linkage is required:
- Terminal receipts MUST reference obligation via parents field
- Without linkage, obligations remain open forever (haunted bootstrap)
